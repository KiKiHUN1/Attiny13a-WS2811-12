# Attiny13a-WS2811-12
I created this project to use an attiny13a to controll a WS2811/12 ledstip.
I searched everywhere for a working one, but i had to edit multiple versions together to get it work.
[Library](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812) is created by [cpldcpu](https://github.com/cpldcpu)

**Usage:**
<br>
-Add a button between pin 3/A3 (#2 leg) and 5v
<br>
-Upload the code with arduino or something 
<br>
-Connect your ledstrips data pin to pin 0 (#5 leg) with some protection resistor(330ohm)
<br><br>
_You can edit the pins in the first lines_
